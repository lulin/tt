# Ideas on Time Tracker

To achieve my goal!

## Functions

* Allocate a time slice
* Schedule a task by recommendation, or request
* Create tasks, projects, sub-tasks, sub-projects & targets, targets can be used to gather other items
* Energy estimate, energy is about your power and willingness to accomplish tasks
	* so what's the measurement of energy? -- time slices used on  hard work
* There are pre-estimated energy and actual energy. Energy could be overdrawn
* Energy in a day, in a week, in a month, and in months, under different time span, the curve of energy figures out your power
* Happyness estimate. energy and happyness are both important. If you are too engaged, there could be no persistent high energy
* Tomato working style timing, when you start a task, a timer started along with that, you can stop it manually, or otherwise it should be stopped right at its due time.
* Some tasks, possibly important or tense, must be reviewed before the next day, a brief report, article or outline recall could be required, to demonstrate the effort on them
* Tasks could be loose or tense
* Recent projects/tasks should be sliced to adjust tomato timing, i.e., every step must be operable
* Time using rate is collected and analyzed
* Efficiency is analyzed
* Entertainment or every trivial things could be taken account
* Datas like time using, energy estimating and efficiency analyzing are able to be displayed using data visualization
* Report missed time
* Time waste, the default state if you don't do any work

## Other funcitons

* Reward?
* Privacy consideration? use privacy level tag?

## How to handle interrupts

If something interrupts you working, and an associated timer is ticking, you could:

* Stop the timer, then start a new timer if needed, or
* Leave it behind, you should then make a report at review time

## Principles

* Importance-urgence principle
* 20-80 principle
* Tomato working style timing

The process might be tough, but please practise in no pain.
